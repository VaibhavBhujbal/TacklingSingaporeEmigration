People want to emigrate because there are better options elsewhere for research, lifestyle and welfare. With regards to welfare, SG is astonishingly poor with regards to managing people of special needs. If no money to migrate, family just suffers. So it is a wise option to at least entertain the thought of acquiring another citizenship for the future.

TLDR just allow dual citizenship. Confirm less ppl throwing SG passport at Pinky's first. No idea how they'll solve the NS issue though but hey, high paid job should also entail difficult work"

7/26/2018 20:33:03,Singapore Citizen,18 - 25,English Teacher in Japan,Female,Yes,"I have been in Japan for 2 years. I might not permanently live here but I don't see myself returning to Singapore, except to visit family","Quality of Life, Political Scene, Education, Over-crowding, Government Transparency, Singapore has changed so much. I don't recognise it as the place I ""grew up in"" anymore. ",Maybe,"1. I was an art student. The art education in Singapore is so sad. It's a dumping ground for people who 'cannot study', many lecturers and classmates are just like PAP style - high-handed, selfish, caring about yourself others, appearances mattering more than actual quality. I had a terribly miserable time as a poly and uni student. So so so so miserable. People tried to sabotage my work. They hated that I made nicer art and had better English (how petty!!) Lecturers were afraid we'd steal their jobs. I hated my student life so much. I am glad I am now free from all that bullshit. I nearly failed both poly and uni, and ironically a lot of people agree that I had the better technical skills in art-making than many of my peers. 
2. People in Singapore often have no patience, myself included when I go back to visit. It's the way the country is. Everything must do fast chopchop quality not important unless you are paying top dollar. How can people live like this? Here, whether Japanese or other foreigners, most people are much more empathetic and less bitchy. During natural disasters / bad weather conditions everyone is patient and sympathetic to each other. 
3. Scam and blame culture in Singapore. In Japan, things are really you-pay-for-what-you-get. In Singapore when something is expensive it doesn't always means it will do what it's supposed to! So frustrating. In Singapore, if someone comes up with a scam, the people who were cheated are told they are stupid for not being careful. Here, we blame the actual criminal! The victims get sympathy. 
4. Way of thinking. Singapore is materialistic and people have a defeatist attitude. I'm not interested in following the PAP plotted lifeplan (finish school, get job, apply bto, pay loans, complain things expensive then claim bopian) sorry i don't believe in bopian. After uni i worked part time for 3 months. I had 3k sgd. I bought a one way ticket to Japan. And did job hunting. I make sgd 1.8k-2.6k per month and I'm happier this way. Way happier. If someone hands me a 10k/month job in singapore I will likely turn it down. 
5. Elitism. Singapore is a multiracial society with lots of foreigners, but we have fixed social castes that won't overlap. A Chinese uni grad would never become friends with a construction worker. In Japan there are lots of foreigners here literally from all over the world, and we all came with a general intent to understand culture. Japanese also befriend you for who you are, not what education or job you have. It's so difficult to explain to them the SG system of expats, locals and construction workers. My friends are from everywhere, some came with little money. They do things like cycling 1h30min to avoid paying for transport. You can be anyone from anywhere and be poorer than a 'bangla' or 'maid' in Singapore, but that won't affect if someone becomes friends with you. Being a construction worker isn't looked down on here, it's just a job. Which is how things should be. "
